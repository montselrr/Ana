			<h4>Artists</h4>
			<div class="grid">

			<p>
				KC ORTIZ
			is a Chicago-based, Alabama-raised rapper who lets her church roots shine through in her gritty yet glamorous hip-hop. With a mix of twangy southern flow and Chicago toughness, her music is nothing if not unpredictable; you’re liable to hear her rap about sex and Jesus in a single couplet. But more than that, her work is about celebrating herself for who she is, it has a powerful, unique message that demands you get out of your seat.

		</p>
			<p>
			Mikky Blanco
			He is considered a pioneer in the so-called queer rap or gay rap, and unlike other gay rappers, as well as a performer, actor, poet with a good silence for the spokenword and activist, he does not deny his roots in the East Coast to which he moved at 16 years, and where he discovered and appropriated hip hop. He makes analogies between gang-related violence and the rugged, promiscuous, drug addict, and sidos gay world, one that is not usually addressed by Sam Smith or Ricky Martin.

		</p>
			<p>
			Torraine Futurum
			A model, activist, influencer, and a musician on the rise. She first made waves in the fashion industry in late 2016. She walked for Gogo Graham and Vaquera at New York Fashion Week. Since then, Futurum has appeared in fashion shoots for photographers like Petra Collins and in magazines including Dazed, i-D, and more.  Her vocalization of her life as a Black model of trans experience has garnered praise and admiration from several well-known activists.

		</p>
			<p>
			Juliana Huxtable
			She is an American artist, writer, performer, DJ, and co-founder of the New York-based Shock Value project. Huxtable has exhibited and performed at various venues, including Reena Spaulings Fine Art, Project Native Informant, Artists Space, the New Museum, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Portland Institute of Contemporary Arts, and the Institute of Contemporary Arts. In his DJ activity, Huxtable regularly integrates his poetry into his remixes

		</p>
			<p>
			SOPHIE
		This Scottish electropop star’s music is as fun and bubbly as it is occasionally strange, but that hasn’t stopped SOPHIE’s climb to become one of the hottest artists on this list. Her work’s mix of traditional instruments with plenty of nontraditional noises and vocal effects (like actual bubble and slurping sounds), are stuff that’s earned praise from a slew of outlets, including Billboard and Pitchfork.

		</p>
			<p>
			SATEEN
		A real-life couple (Queen Sateen and Exquisite) and disco duo from Brooklyn, is known for blending strong social statements. Exquisite came out as trans in 2016, and they’ve only continued their ascent since. Their self-titled EP, released last year, serves as a “flamboyant celebration of the couple’s journey, channeling their collective queerness into music that’s equally a political war cry and a flashy pop project”.

		</p>

			Arca
			Alejandra Ghersi, (formerly Alejandro Ghersi; Caracas, October 14, 1989), better known by her stage name Arca, is a Venezuelan transgender singer and producer, based in Spain, whose work is specialized in electronic and experimental music.

		</p>
			<p>

On March 9, 2017, Jezebel published Ruiz's essay entitled "The Persistent Trauma of the Search for Love as a Trans Youth" where he addresses how shame can lead to abusive relationships.

		</p>
			<p>
			Kim Petras
			If you’ve been to a gay bar in the past year, chances are you’ve heard of Kim Petras — and if not, you’ve definitely heard her music. With her long blond hair and a wardrobe heavy on relaxed ‘90s fashion, the rising star has made a name for herself with her shamelessly cheeky brand of bubblegum pop. From the #SugarDaddyGoals of debut single “I Don’t Want It All” to the teenage diary entry relatability of “Hillside Boys,” Petras’ music balances tongue-in-cheek lyrics with irresistibly catchy hooks.
		</p>
			<p>
			The Clicks
			A rock band founded in 2004 in Toronto by leader Lucas Silveira. The band has had a colorful history that became an artistic parallel to Silveira's intersection of personal with creative life. The Cliks no longer work due to Silveira's hearing loss and tinnitus complications, but occasionally, when the musical siren call, you can hear him doing a low-profile performance, acoustic guitar, or piano.
		</p>
			<p>
			AH-MER-AH-SU
			Having live since 2011, the young woman is not only a leader in her trans community, but also a highly sought-after nightlife presence, a member of a growing wave of trans talents of color who are finally creating events that cater to her own interests. She is a rising star, her musical mastery is a magnificent canvas on which to paint the realities of life as a trans black woman in America, swinging on the brink of fascism and a white supremacist government.
		</p>
			<p>
			Shea Diamond
			Exploded onto the scene in 2016 with her scathing yet molasses-sweet soul single “I Am Her.” With lyrics like “Don't care too much what other people say/I get along swell by my goddamn self/Never asked for no one's philosophy/It's obvious I'm proud of me,” the song tackles identity and self-esteem in unabashed terms. The music it’s largely about about loving herself as a Black trans woman, and is usually as political as it is catchy.

		</p>
			<p>
			Anohni
			She is a British transgender singer, songwriter and visual artist, best known as singer and band leader Antony and the Johnsons. Anohni is transgender and uses the feminine to self-refer. In an interview with Flavorwire in November 2014, she stated "My closest friends and family use the feminine pronoun to refer to me. I have not asked the press to do so in a specific way ... In my personal life I prefer" she "I think words are important. To call a person by their chosen gender is to honor their spirit.
		</p>
			<p>
			Octa Octa
